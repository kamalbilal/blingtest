        <strong>Cancellation</strong><br><br>
        Whether it is a shift in social accounts or a break from social media, we understand and respect your choices. We look forward to making your process of moving on from Bling easier.
        <br><br>You can cancel your account at any time you choose.
        <br><br>Note: A cancellation request can be raised at any time but the change will only come into effect at the end of your billing cycle.
        <br><br>To make the process more efficient and transparent, we have given you complete autonomy and responsibility for properly canceling your account. You can cancel your account at any time from the “Edit Profile” page. Only the account owner has access to this page. If you need assistance, then email your account cancellation request from your registered email address to us at help@bling.cloud.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Refund</strong><br><br>
        Bling believes in a fair refund policy. If you forgot to cancel your subscription, or if you haven’t used your plan for more than a day after the last charge, we’d be happy to refund your latest charge in full. However, we cannot grant prorated refunds if you’ve canceled after using your plan for more than a day.
        <br><br>If you have an annual subscription, we won’t be able to process any refunds. For any questions or concerns, please contact us at help@bling.cloud.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Upgrades and Downgrades</strong><br><br>
        You can switch between any plans at any time during your subscription period. When you switch from a higher cost plan to a lower cost plan, you will only be charged for the number of days you used the plan. The remaining amount for the unused time will be saved as Bling credits in your account which you can utilize for future billing.
        <br><br>In case of an upgrade from a lower cost plan to a higher cost plan, you’ll be charged according to your old plan for the number of days you used the plan. We’ll adjust the remaining credit amount on a pro rata basis so that you only have to pay the balance amount for the new higher-priced plan.
        <br><br>To raise a request to downgrade your plan, email us at help@bling.cloud from your registered email address.
