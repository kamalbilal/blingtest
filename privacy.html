        <strong><u>HOW WE USE THIS INFORMATION</u></strong><br>
        www.bling.cloud on occasion, may share “personal information” with third-party service providers as we deem
        necessary for the third-party to fulfill their duties, such as fulfilling orders, processing credit card
        payments, or other functions necessary to our business. These third-party service providers are not authorized
        to retain, share, store or use the personal information for any purposes other than to provide the services for
        which they have been hired to provide. When personal information is submitted, the user agrees that we may use
        the personal information to make contact with the party. We do not sell, trade or otherwise share personal
        information with unrelated third parties for their own marketing purposes, however, we may market certain offers
        on behalf of third parties.
        <br><br>
        We use personal, aggregate information and third-party network information in an effort to improve our users’
        experience on the site and with the services, and to communicate with them about information that they request.
        We may also use this information to help us target specific services or offers to users, to help us develop and
        improve the site and services, and to tailor our site and services to the users’ interests.
        <br><br>
        We may also disclose “aggregate information” and third-party network information (business profile and content
        information) to third parties. Aggregate information may be disclosed to third parties for a variety of business
        reasons, including to advertisers to inform them of the usage habits or characteristics of the interested
        audience, and to potential investors so that they may better understand our user base, etc. Social content
        information may be disclosed to third parties and to other users for a variety of reasons, including to give
        them better insights into general trends and consumer response metrics. Neither aggregate information nor social
        content information will include any personal information, and we will not disclose any personal information
        except as expressly stated elsewhere in this Policy.
        <br><br>
        In addition to the foregoing, www.bling.cloud may elect to share or transfer your personal information to
        unrelated third parties: (i) to comply with a legal requirement, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal
        process served on www.bling.cloud, (ii) to investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (iii)
        in connection with the sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of www.bling.clou;
        (iv) when we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of www.bling.clou or other
        persons, or (v) as otherwise required or permitted by law.
        <br><br>
        <strong><u>WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING THIS INFORMATION</u></strong><br>

        information or deleting information about you, please email us at help@bling.cloud. Please note that we may need
        to retain certain information about you for as long as you maintain an account for our services, to provide you

        obligations, to resolve disputes, or to enforce the applicable terms of service or other agreement in place
        between you (or your organization) and Bling (the “Terms of Service”).
        <br><br>
        Requests to access, correct, or delete your information will be handled within thirty (30) days unless they are
        unusually extensive or complex, in which case we will advise you of the expected timeline for handling your
        request.
        <br><br>
        You may opt-out of marketing communications sent by Bling by notifying us through an email response or you can

        <br><br>
        <strong><u>HOW DO WE SAFEGUARD YOUR INFORMATION</u></strong><br>
        We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration,
        disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage, and
        processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized
        access to systems where we store personal information.
        <br><br>
        We restrict access to personal information to Bling employees, service providers, and agents who need to know
        that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by
        confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if
        they fail to meet these obligations. We use Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) technology to encrypt and protect the
        security of your personal information, including but not limited to your credit card number, when it is sent
        over the Internet. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure,
        however. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
        security.
        <br><br>
        www.bling.cloud processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in
        accordance with this policy. We review our data collection, storage, and processing practices to ensure that we
        only collect, store, and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take
        reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we
        depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.
        <br><br>
        <strong><u>HOW LONG DO WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION</u></strong><br>
        When you connect your third-party sites to the Bling Platform, we may fetch, cache, and aggregate the data from
        the connected sites to display and enable you to modify the information. We retain your information only as long
        as required to provide the services requested by you, for record-keeping purposes, to comply with our legal
        obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce the terms for the services.
        <br><br>
        After it is no longer necessary for us to retain information about you, we will dispose of it in a secure manner
        or anonymize the information.
        <br><br>
        Aggregated data is used by Bling for analysis, product improvement, and troubleshooting purposes. In some cases,
        content may continue to exist on the social networks even after you or we delete it from our services, and you
        will need to contact the relevant third-party network or social network directly if you want it to remove this
        content.
        <br><br>
