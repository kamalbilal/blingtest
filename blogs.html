            </summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it’s Bling who’s come to give you an extraordinary business day!</p>
                <br>

                <p>Meet Mr. Olly. He’s an absolutely talented person who decided that he should create a business
                    so that his skills could help serve people throughout the entire world. In the beginning,
                    everything was going absolutely swimmingly. That is until his products gained critical
                    acclaim and a sea of customers came flooding into his life. He thought he could try to swim
                    past his problems, but the volume of orders being placed seemed to be taking over his life
                    until he felt he was drowning in them. Exhausted, Mr. Olly cried out to the universe, “What can I
                    do?”</p>
                <br>
                <p><i>And that’s when Bling came in…</i></p>
                <br>
                <p> “Well, you could always seek my help,” Bling said in all his magnificence.
                    Mr. Olly looked at him with tears still in his eyes asking, “Who are you?”</p>
                <br>
                <p>Bling smiled as he quickly sorted out the orders being placed through an amazing list,
                    responded to all the customers that were reaching out to Mr. Olly through Facebook and Instagram,
                    and gave Mr. Olly a brand new business phone for everything to go on even smoother.</p>
                <br>
                <p>With once tears of sadness that were now replaced with tears of joy, Mr. Olly thanked Bling and
                    asked, “Can you always come by to help me?”</p>
                <br>
                <p>Bling gave a thumbs up and told Mr. Olly, “I’ll always be here.”</p>
                <br>
                <p>Since then, Mr. Olly never felt like he was drowning in his customers’ orders and was always given
                    reviews from satisfied clients.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Could you be facing the same set of problems Mr. Olly once did? Could you also be in need of a
                    superhero? Well, never fear for Bling will always be here!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Like what Bling did with Mr. Olly, you can be sure that Bling can cater to YOUR business needs.</p>

                    Responsibility</span></summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>A big sea of customers can be a big thing for any business, but they can also bring some drastic
                    issues if you don’t handle your business’ transition to sudden popularity well.
                </p><br>
                <p>There is certainly no denying that all businesses are dying to be able to cater to huge volumes of
                    customers. Having a ton of clients, after all, keeps a business afloat and alive. In addition to
                    that, it just screams how much your business has gone through great heights and that you could
                    achieve so much more success from it. But as good as having a load of customers is and how you could
                    gain so much from it, there’s also the notion that you could lose a lot of your business from it.
                    After all, too much of one thing can be bad.
                </p><br>
                <p>Here are all of the deets on the disadvantages you could supposedly get if you have a sudden big sea
                    of customers rolling in. And if you wouldn’t want to experience any of these or maybe can already
                    identify with some of the disadvantages on this list, continue reading after to find out the key to
                    solving all of them!
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Disadvantage #1. Responding to Clients On Time Could Become Difficult.
                    </strong></p><br>
                <p>Sending messages to respond to the orders or services subscribed to us to a few people here and there
                    should be easy. Unfortunately, though, such a scenery tends to be unlikely when customers suddenly
                    flood into our business. While it is true that you should always be thankful for the rush of
                    customers, it’s also important to recognize the downside that comes with such a blessing. With so
                    many clients just coming in and in, you might not be able to find time to respond to them well or
                    cater to their every need, most especially if you don’t exactly have enough people to constantly
                    check all the social media platforms of your business (with today’s climate, we all need access to
                    all of those sites). And if you aren’t able to manage all those, you could be at risk of receiving
                    ratings from unsatisfied customers. And if you keep receiving ratings from unsatisfied customers,
                    your business could be at risk of falling down to the point that it could be too difficult to piece
                    it all back together London Bridge style.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Disadvantage #2. There’s More of a Chance You Might Deal with Untrustworthy Customers.
                    </strong></p><br>
                <p>While trust is essential in any relationship, including in business, let’s face the facts: the world
                    can be a harsh place. And yes, while there are people who can trick small businesses, the chance of
                    having untrustworthy customers who can cost you big time and have you and your business with the
                    short end of the stick are significantly increased as your business continues to grow. It’s not
                    exactly a pretty sight and is definitely something you should always be prepared for.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Disadvantage #3. Trying to Keep on Track with Everything Can Feel Impossible.
                    </strong></p><br>
                <p>Even if you were able to respond to all of your customers, it can be really difficult to keep track
                    if you were able to really deliver the order or service they have been requesting for. Since you are
                    only human, there’s a high chance that you might experience times when you weren’t able to exactly
                    deliver the product properly, on time, or even at all. Feeling overwhelmed and not being able to
                    keep things under control can lead you to spiral into intense stress and sadness (this is most
                    especially if you’re the type of person who just wants everything organized well).
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>So, What’s the Key to Solving All These Problems?
                    </strong></p><br>
                <p>As damaging and as true as these disadvantages may be, there is actually a way to never have to
                    experience all this. That would be by subscribing to Bling!

            <summary><span style="margin: 5px; font-weight: 500px">Organize to Financialize: This Is Why Your Business,
                    Big or Small, Needs Good Structure</span></summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>An organized structure is essential to pave the way for any business, whether small or big, to
                    continue moving towards success.
                </p><br>
                <p>Picture this: times have changed and Jane has finally realized and decided that it’s high time that
                    she started her own business. She plans everything she’ll ever need and the launch goes incredibly
                    well. She’s gained a few customers here and there and since she’s still quite a small business, she
                    decides that it’s fine to just toss through all those orders. However, lo and behold, one day, she's
                    suddenly bombarded by a ton of orders, not expecting that her business would suddenly blow up like
                    this. As she is unprepared, tons of problems arise and the whole business soon crumbles down.
                </p><br>
                <p>It truly is an unfortunate incident that could have been completely avoided if Jane had only
                    organized her business from the start. After all, a properly organized structure can lead a business
                    to great success and victory.
                </p><br>
                <p>In case you aren’t exactly convinced just yet, we have got all that handled, because we’ve compiled
                    the main reasons why organizing is just so important and *how* exactly it can even bring you to the
                    promised land of success.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Reason #1. More Balance, Less Stress. Less Stress, More Time.
                    </strong></p><br>
                <p>Imagine having all those files you’ll need stored and arranged properly in one place, communication
                    between you and the other people you have employed along the way through your business being
                    manageable, and you finally getting to find an effective time management routine that doesn’t hinder
                    you from enjoying your personal life. Now, try to employ organization in your life and into your
                    business. You won’t have to imagine all this after that, because you’ll actually be enjoying all
                    these advantages once you do. And once you do, you can finally say goodbye to all that aching stress
                    and spend time with your family and friends without having to keep all those anxieties about your
                    business! You can finally live the best life you deserve!
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Reason #2. Embracing the Balance Means Embracing the Customers.
                    </strong></p><br>
                <p>When it comes to achieving success in business, customer satisfaction is one of the key factors that
                    must be attained. If you as a business owner don’t get to fix all those orders for services that
                    come in, there’s a chance that you won’t be able to deliver what exactly your customers are hoping
                    for from you. That means you would have to say goodbye to your business growth for some time. No one
                    obviously wants that to happen, so what can you do? Simple. Organize. Once you practice the power to
                    organize, you’ll become the hero of your own business in no time!
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Reason #3. Find a Tool that Can Assist You in Organizing Your Business.
                    </strong></p><br>
                <p>It’s true that organizing may not be an easy feat to achieve, most especially if one just isn’t used
                    to it, but that doesn’t mean you should give up so easily. In fact, it’s highly advised that you get
                    a tool that can aid you in your path to organization. There are many tools out there that are
                    designed to help businesses achieve the best of the best by solidifying balance into the business.
                    One of the best tools out there is Bling! A customer communications tool that keeps all your
                    customer communication in ONE place, Bling has been built in order to help all business owners out

                    communication would be manageable and that all those orders would be delivered.
                </p><br>
                <p>In addition to all that, what sets Bling apart from other business tools out there is that it has
                    also been made to protect businesses from customers who could potentially scam or be too difficult
                    to handle. Aside from all those problems as a result of clutter, you can be sure that with Bling,
                    you would be extremely safe!

                    Barriers!</span></summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Your small business can shine but these barriers block it before it can see the light of day.
                </p><br>
                <p>If you’re an owner of a small business who is trying to get by but can barely do so and thinking
                    maybe that it’s because you and your business are just not cut out for the world, you may want to
                    think again. Every single business deserves to be in the spotlight and if your business just isn’t
                    there yet, it most likely has something to do with the common barriers small businesses have to deal
                    with. If one of the barriers on this list is something you feel you’re dealing with at the moment,
                    then you have surely come to the right place! Because we’re here to show you how to punch through
                    and finally break those barriers to finally get the hype that your small business deserves.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Barrier #1. The Idea that Competition is “Bad”.
                    </strong></p><br>
                <p>So many people have so many business ideas that they create into reality in so many different places
                    in the same decade that it can be difficult to actually make a business idea that has never been
                    seen before. Eventually, you are bound to find a business that sells the same products or services
                    as you. Once you do, you’ve finally got yourself some competition.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Solution?</strong> While competition can bring up a lot of pressure and doubt, competition in
                    the realm of business doesn’t automatically mean that you have to feel down. In fact, if anything,
                    when it comes to business, competition should be taken as a good thing. Restructure your thoughts
                    and realize that you can actually contribute well to the economy thanks to that competition How?
                    Well, with the competition you’ll be thinking about how to improve the quality of your products or
                    sell things at more affordable prices – factors that can be really helpful to the consumer
                    population around the world. Oh, and another added bonus to the competition would be the motivation
                    that you can get from it once you take it as a positive thing.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Barrier #2. Being Too Much of a Risk Taker.
                    </strong></p><br>
                <p>It’s true that to be a good business owner, you’ll need to be a risk-taker. After all, business
                    always comes with risks. But even so, that doesn’t mean that you should blindly step into whatever
                    risk and harbor that “I’ll cross the bridge when I get there” attitude. If you take too many risks,
                    your business may be at risk of crumbling.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Solution?</strong> Balance your risk-taking personality with methods that can also keep your
                    business secure. List down all the problems that you have encountered or even may encounter in the
                    future and find ways to be able to responsibly solve them.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Barrier #3. Old School Marketing Strategies.
                    </strong></p><br>
                <p>Marketing strategies are so important when it comes to establishing business growth because they
                    basically increase your customer reach and really get your business known! If you use incredibly
                    old-fashioned marketing strategies, you are at risk of your business not getting the proper
                    promotion.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Solution?</strong> Make use of technology and get the word out through all the social media
                    platforms you know. Enlist family and friends to help you promote your business. Get to know the
                    trending hashtags or things like SEO, aesthetic web designs, and attractive socials! Learn more
                    about marketing by enrolling in courses that give the details on the new and more effective ways to
                    do it or read books on consumer psychology! If you can implement all of this, then your business
                    will grow even further!
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Barrier #4. Failed Relationships with Customers.
                    </strong></p><br>
                <p>Being unorganized can be really costly. If you don’t manage the orders of your customers well, you
                    are bound to get a dissatisfying rating. If you get dissatisfying ratings, your customer reach may
                    fail to grow.
                </p><br>
                <p><strong>Solution?</strong> Organize! In a previous blog post, we’ve listed all the ways on how you
                    can do so. Click here to know more! In addition to that, you can also solve all this and regain your
